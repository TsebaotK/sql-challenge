# sql-challenge

In this assignment I used the PgAdmin to create a table for six CSV files specifying the data types, primary keys and foreign keys. I then created a diagram that shows the relationship between each table using the QuickDBD tool.
I imported the CSV file into the corresponding SQL table and analyzed the data to list the requested questions.
