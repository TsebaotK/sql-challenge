# sql-challenge

In this assignment I used the PgAdmin to create six tables for the six CSV files specifying the data types, primary keys and foreign keys. I then created a diagram that shows the relationship between each table using the QuickDBD tool.
I imported the CSV file into the corresponding SQL table and analyzed the data to list the the following:
  1.	The employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
  2.	The first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who hired in 1986.
  3.	The manager of each department, along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
  4.	The department number for each employee, along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  5.	The first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
  6.	Each sales department employee includes their employee number, last name, and first name.
  7.	The Sales and Development department employees, among with their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  8.	The frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employees’ last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
